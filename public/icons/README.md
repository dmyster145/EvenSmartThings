# Glasses display icons

Copy your PNG assets here with these exact names:

- **ThumbsUp.png** — shown when all devices succeed (top-center)
- **ThumbsDown.png** — shown when all devices fail (top-center)
- **ThisClose.png** — shown when some devices work and some don’t (top-center)
- **LightOn.png** — solid lightbulb for "on" scenes (right)
- **LightOff.png** — outline lightbulb for "off" scenes (right)

They will be scaled to the container sizes (80×48 for thumbs/ThisClose, 64×64 for lightbulbs). If a file is missing, the app falls back to simple placeholder shapes.
